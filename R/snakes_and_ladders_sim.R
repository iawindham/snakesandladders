#'Runs the entire Snakes and Ladders Simulation using user specified parameters
#'
#'This prompts the user to specify all of the necessary parameters, and then runs through \code{add_snakesandladders(), create_transmatrix(), markov_chain(), and finish_game_chance()}.
#'It then prints the most probable number of turns it will take to win the game, and a graph of the output of \code{finish_game_chance()} versus the number of turns.
#'This function takes no arguments, and instead prompts the user for all the necessary parameters.
#'The default settings for the game can also be used.
#'
#'Try experimenting with different parameter settings to see what you get.
#'@return A plot of the output of \code{finishgamechance} versus the number of turns.  This distribution shows how probable it is to win the game in x number of turns.
